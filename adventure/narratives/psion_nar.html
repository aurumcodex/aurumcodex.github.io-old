<!-- telepathy path -->
<p id="telepathy_1">
    Using your psychic capabilities, you try and contact your friend via telepathy in order 
    to gain your bearings while searching for them within the tower ruins. <br>
    Your friend seems to enjoy a familiar voice enter their head for once, and starts guiding 
    you up the tower. <br>
    They tell you to go right down the ground floor hallway.

</span>

<p id="telepathy_2">
    After coming to the end of the hallway on the ground floor, your friend tells you to head up 
    the stairs, which just so happens to be only way up. makes sense, you think to yourself. 
</p>

    <button id="telepathy_bttn_2"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="telepathy_3">
    As you make your way up the stairwell, you ask your friend how they know the way up. <br>
    they reply, "because they dragged me up this way, how else would I have known?" <br>
    You just shake your head in amusement at that remark, and continue up the stairway.
</p>

<span id="telepathy_menu_3">
    <button id="telepathy_bttn_3"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="telepathy_4">
    You reach the top of the stairway, and prompt your friend where to next. They respond with 
    "head straight down the hallway." simple enough, you remark, but, you can't help but feel a 
    trap could possibly lie within, so you prepare for anything. <br>
    You sprint down the hallway of the top floor of the ruins, toward the end of the same hallway.
    In front of you stands a massive set of double oak doors that lead to where your friend resides.

</span>

<p id="telepathy_5">
    You press on the two doors opening them enough that you can fit through and enter the chamber 
    that lies ahead.

<!-- path of no telepathy -->
<p id="no_telepathy_1f">
    You decide to not use your telepathy abilities, due to your concern that your friend's kidnapper 
    might be able to detect your approaching and want to keep an element of surprise where possible.
    <br>
    You enter the ruins and are immediately met with a fork.

<p id="no_tlpthy_1f_left">
    You come to the end of the hallway, and find nothing but a bunch of cobwebs. You are stunned at how 
    dusty everything is, and return down the path, and take the right path, and eventually come to a stairwell.
    You decide to take the stairs, as you see no other way up.
</p>

<p id="no_tlpthy_1f_right">
    Your intuition guiding you, you turn right, and head down that pathway. as you walk down the corridor, 
    you happen to see the only possible way forward, a stairwell. You decide to take it, as you have no other 
    real options for ascending the tower.

<p id="no_telepathy_2f">
    After you acsend the set of stairs, you see a bunch of possible empty rooms and at the end of the main 
    corridor a set of massive double oak doors.

<p id="no_telepathy_2f_srch">
    You decide to go searching in the myriad of empty rooms. <br>
    After many opened doors leading to nothing but ruined de&#x0301;cor, cobwebs, and copious amounts of dust, 
    you have exhausted all of the possible doors that aren't the big double oak doors.
</p>

<p id="no_telepathy_2f_hall">
    You go down the hallway to approach the massive double oak doors. <br>
    You open the doors to confront your friend's kidnapper.

<!-- // boss section // -->
<p id="boss_init">
    As you enter the large room past the massive double oak doors, you see your friend tied up on what looks 
    to be an altar of some sort. Curiously, you only see on black cloaked person beside the altar. <br>
    You try to use reason at the cloaked figure, but nothing seems to phase it. <br>
    Instead it sends a large mass of psychic energy towards you, cathcing you somewhat off-guard.

<p id="orb_dodge">
    Seeing the orb of energy coming at you, you attempt to dodge out of the way of it, but realize as you 
    are moving out of the way, that it homes in on its target, so no amount of dodging is going to make it 
    disappear. <br>
    Just as you think you're safe from the orb though, due to your concentration lapsing for a short moment, 
    the orb envelops you, and releases an ominous light. A feeling of what feels like one thousand electrified 
    needles envelops you, and you scream in agony, as your conciousness fades.
</p>

<p id="orb_bounce">
    Seeing the orb come at you, you decide to play a bit of billiards with it, and send your own orb of energy 
    at the orb coming at you. It hits the enemy's orb squarely in the middle, and it goes ricocheting off towards 
    the cloaked figure. After some bouncing around, it smacks into the figure, covering it an ominous light, and 
    after the light subsides, the cloaked figure slumps over, unresponsive. <br><br>
    After checking on the figure, and on your friend, you assist them in getting untied and manage to escape the 
    ruins as they start collapsing due to the energy orb ricochets.
