<!-- charge path taken -->
<p id="charge">
    You decide to charge headfirst into the forest. <br>
    A few minutes after entering and taking a pathway, <br>
    you hear what sounded like an animal's cry for help. <br>
    Knowing that it <i>could</i> be a trap, you weigh your decisions.

<p id="resume_chrg_path">
    Uncertain of the risks, you decided to ignore the cry and carry on with your romp through the forest. <br>
    
    After some time through your walk, you discover a campsite with a dwindling campfire. <br>
    You are still some yards away from it, however, and you wonder if it's safe to approach it.

    You then continue along the path you were walking. <br> <br>
    Upon you arrival, you spot that the inhabitants are injured in some form. <br>
    You query who seems to be the leader of the group about what caused the injuries. <br>

<p id="investigation">
    The noise has piqued your interest, and you decide to go in its general direction. <br>
    You arrive at a small clearing where you hear the same cry-like noise.
    However, it sounds slightly different than it did earlier in the trail.

    On checking the noise, you notice at the very lsst possible second a small 
    gremlin fire a toxic dart into your neck. <br>
    You are unable to react in time to the threat, and the dart gets lodged into
    your neck, with a force great enough to puncture a vein. <br>
    You collapse, writhing in agony, as the poison seeps into your body, slowly killing you.

<!-- sense path taken -->
<p id="sense">
    Taking a deep breath, you decide to focus your senses
    to expect any dangers that might arise within the forest. <br><br>
    After your brief moment of calming meditation to hone your senses, you enter the forest, 
    and not too far in, you come to a fork that splits three ways.

<p id="left_path">
    With the left path looking enticing to your senses, you decide to go down that path.
    You happen to find some food that had been left over for some reason, 
    and it looks recently dropped, too.
    You decide to collect it.

<p id="rght_path">
    Staring off into space for a short while contemplating your options on which path to take,
    you decide to meander down the right pathway. <br><br>
    Coming to a dead end, you happen to spot a treasure chest in a clearing, looking rather old and abandoned. <br>
    You think about whether or not to open it.
</p>

    Throwing caution to the wind, you take a swift jab at the rusted lock on the chest, breaking it. <br>
    Upon opening he chest, which makes an obnoxiously loud creaking noise, you peer into the depths of the chest. <br><br>
    You obtained a few decently sized (albiet small) gems that are of some value.
</p>

<p id="leave_it">
    Uncertain if the chest is a trap or not, you decide to leave the chest unopened, and depart from it.

<p id="midl_path">
    You deided to follow the middle path down. <br>
    Out of the corner of your eye, however, you spot a glint from deeper in the forest. <br>
    Unsure of what it is, you question what it is.

<p id="ignored">
    Assuming that the glint was merely nothing, you decide to ignore the glint. <br>
    However, it was the shiny part of an arrowhead heading right at you at a high velocity. <br>
    One lodges itself into your leg, right above your knee, while many more suddenly appear and 
    turn you into a pincushion full of arrows.
</p>

<p id="crouched">
    Unsure of what the glint was, you crouch deftly, as only a ranger/hunter could. <br>
    All of a sudden, dozens of arrows go wizzing by your head as you are crouched down. <br>
    You wait for a few moments before you stand back up, breathing a sigh of relief when the barage is over.
</p>

<span id="crouched_menu">
    <button id="crouch_continue"> continue down path </button>

<p id="midl_cont">
    After the arrow bargae from nowhere ends, you continue down the path you were on,

    or if it could be completely harmless to go visit.

<p id="snse_camp_apprch">
    After weighing your options, you decide to head towards the camp, if only for a moment of repreive after 
    being nearly killed by a barrage fo arrows. <br>
    You enter the campsite, and upon arrival, you see that the inhabitants of said camp are in 
    pretty bad shape. You tend to their wounds as best as you can using what little supplies they have available.
    Afterwards, you approach someone who seems to be their leader. <br>
    They tell you what happened was because of the monster you are also hunting. A tip is given to you to duck when 
    the Chupacabra roars and starts to spin around.

<!-- boss seciton below -->
<p id="boss_init">
    You spot a large beast resting in a clearing, and it seems to have noticed you already. <br>
    You recognize it as the beast you were searching for: the Chupacabra. <br>
    The beast starts spinning toward you, as it's infamously known for that sort of thing. 
    As it's spinning, you have just enough time to do one action.

    As you are doing so, you look up just in time to get rolled over the firt time by the Chupacabra.
    Lying on the ground in agony, the Chupacabra senses that you're in terrible condition and takes 
    advantage of the situation. You get rolled over again, and again, and again, until you lay there, 
    motionless.

<p id="tried_ducking">
    Seeing the Chupacabra spinning around like a crazed beast, you instinctively duck down, as to hope 
    for it going over your head. It does so, and in your breif moment of reprieve, you nock an arrow, 
    in hopes of landing it in the beast. <br><br>
    The Chupacabra spins around like a floating disc, and is head toward you a second time. <br>
    Readying your bow, you line up your shot, and unleash the arrow into a weak spot that you cleverly 
    discovered as the beast was spinning above your head. <br>
    The beast, now injured, stops spinning madly, and flops around. You unleash a few more arrows to 
    finish the job properly.
