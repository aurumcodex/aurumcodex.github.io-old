        <h1> Concept Page </h1>
        <p id="concept_desc">
            Put simply, the concept of this page is to create a sort of text-based, choose-your-own-adventure 
            type of web narrative. There are boss fights, and currently only three different paths to choose 
            from, but more are planned to be added. The artwork featured here is not of my own making, and is 
            fully credited at the end of the journies. This was done to achieve a sort of cinematic experince, 
            in the aspect of viewing the credits after the content has ended. This type of web narrative was 
            chosen due to my full enjoyment of many role-playing games that allow a type of exploration (however, 
            this site is a bit limited, unfortunately).
