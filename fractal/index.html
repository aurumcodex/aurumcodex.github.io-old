    Overview: This image is a drawing of a tree that exists in an alternate world that has trees similar to ours, but are consistently
    fractal in nature. This is a representation of how a tree would look in such world, which has ambient light of a purple
    hue. The panel at the bottom is merely the ground it would normally be attached to. This is because this alternate world
    experiences a phenomenon in which the trees, when mature enough, will start levitating on their own, without the need of
    a trunk for support. How this occurs is unknown, and the locals don’t seem to mind that this occurs. The floating lights
    are known to the locals as “wisps.” These typically float around a tree, giving additional pops of color to an otherwise
    monotone world bathed in purple. The tree seems to form very differently than outs, growing more geometrically, seemingly
    cube-like in structure. They also come in many degrees of geometric advancement, with some branching many times, and others
    less so. These trees will also at the end of their lifespans crumble back to the ground, and become food for the next generation

  <p> Technical Descriptions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Animation (Objects) - The wisps floating around are moving around due to the clock of the computer, and using some trigonometry functions to move them around. </li>
    <li> Animation (Camera) - The camera was positioned at the coordinates (0, 20, 60) for a better view of the tree on load, and a controller was set to make the camera orbit the center of the display. </li>
    <li> Fractal Tree - An algorithm was utilized in the creation of the tree displayed, although the root of the tree is not visible, making for a unique take on a tree. </li>
    <li> Lighting Effects - There is ambient lighting used for the scene displayed, a direct light is also used, however the point lights floating around (the wisps) make this difficult. The wisps aren't there for show; they do illuminate the tree in a variance in colors. </li>
    <li> Texture Maps - This is showcased in the ground panel, and in the tree. Every prism forming the tree has the same texture, making for a uniform look, with lighting effects enabled. The ground panel does not have lighting effects applied due to the panel being a simple shape. </li>
  </ul>
