    Overview: This image fits the theme in that in this world, trees are grown like normal, but after they are mature enough,
    their trunks will dissolve away, leaving the rest of the tree to be floating for the rest of its lifespan.

  <p> Technical Descriptions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Animation (Objects) - The wisps floating around are moving around due to the clock of the computer, and using some trigonometry functions to move them around. </li>
    <li> Animation (Camera) - The camera was positioned at the coordinates (0, 20, 60) for a better view of the tree on load, and a controller was set to make the camera orbit the center of the display. </li>
    <li> Fractal Tree - An algorithm was utilized in the creation of the tree displayed, although the root of the tree is not visible, making for a unique take on a tree. </li>
    <li> Lighting Effects - There is ambient lighting used for the scene displayed, a direct light is also used, however the point lights floating around (the wisps) make this difficult. The wisps aren't there for show; they do illuminate the tree in a variance in colors. </li>
    <li> Texture Maps - This is showcased in the ground panel, and in the tree. Every prism forming the tree has the same texture, making for a uniform look, with lighting effects enabled. The ground panel does not have lighting effects applied due to the panel being a simple shape. </li>
  </ul>
